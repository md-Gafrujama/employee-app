## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations. Below are the endpoints used:

- **Get All Employees**: `GET /api/employees`
- **Add New Employee**: `POST /api/employees`
- **Update Employee**: `PUT /api/employees/:id`
- **Delete Employee**: `DELETE /api/employees/:id`

Example API call using Axios:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;

export const getEmployees = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/employees`);
  return response.data;
};
```

---

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL of the backend API.

Example:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
